    "We are working for Lending club a finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:\n",
    "•If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company\n",
    "•If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective\n",
    "The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default (loan_status = 'Charged Off'), i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.\n"
